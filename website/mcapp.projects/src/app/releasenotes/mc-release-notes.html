                        Adding or changing composition on a sample was silently failing on the backend. It appeared
                        to the user that the composition was being saved but then wasn't being displayed when viewing
                        the sample.

                        Deleting a task would cause an error saying the note (for the deleted task) couldn't
                        be updated. This error no longer occurs.

                        Tasks associated with a template couldn't be deleted. Now you can delete tasks with unused templates.
                        A template is unused if it doesn't have any files or samples associated with it and isn't being used
                        in a dataset.

                        <b>Fixed:</b>
                        When clicking on a task sometimes the system would think you were trying to move the
                        task to a different position, where that position is the same as the tasks current
                        position. This would cause an error. Now the condition is checked and no move attempt
                        is made if the task isn't actually being moved.

                        When adding files to a process they would be saved, but wouldn't always be displayed.
                        Now files are displayed.

                        Datasets that are published had a link to view the published dataset. This was hard coded
                        to the wrong URL (actually it pointed at Google). It now points at the correct URL.
